									<p>Greetings,
										I'm Shamika Rajan Kadam, born and raised in the lively city of Mumbai, Maharashtra. Currently residing in Currey Road, my upbringing in Mumbai has endowed me with fluency in Marathi, Hindi, Sanskrit, and a touch of Gujarati. Beyond language, my interests span the realms of literature, culinary arts, and music. I have successfully completed my SSC grade at Gloria Convent High School, Byculla, where I attained a remarkable 96%. Currently, I am enrolled at Government Polytechnic Mumbai, pursuing a three-year Diploma course in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am currently in my first year of studies. Coding and exploring various algorithms are passions of mine, and I find joy in honing my skills in this field. Engaging in projects has provided me with recognition in the ever-evolving world of technology. Learning programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, CSS, HTML, etc., is not only enjoyable but also rewarding. Presently, I am involved in projects concerning drone assembly and manufacturing processes. I'm excited about the prospect of getting to know each of you better in our future conversations. It's been a pleasure to introduce myself, and I'm grateful for the chance to do so. I'm also eager to hear your thoughts and insights as we continue our discussions.</p>
